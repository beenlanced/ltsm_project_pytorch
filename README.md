## Project Description

This project utilizes `Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)` neural networks, a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) that address the vanishing graident problem and can better capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

### What this Project Does Specifically

I build two Jupyter notebooks,

- Example 1 - Building a Long Short-Term Memory Unit one Component at a time using `PyTorch and Lightning`
- Example 2 - Building a Long Short-Term Memory Unit using `PyTorch and Lightning`, but taking advantage of `nn.LSTM()`

---

## Objective

The project uses two techninques to visualize the latent space of the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset of handwritten digits:

- [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)
- [t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(t-SNE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding)

The project contains the key elements:

- `Deep Learning` for neural networks building,
- `Git` (version control),
- `Jupyter` python coded notebooks,
- `Lightning` wrapper for PyTorch to make easier to develop and train deep learning models,
- `Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)` neural network variant of RNN to process sequential data,
- `Python` the standard modules,
- `PyTorch` Machine Learning framework to train our deep neural network,
- `Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)`,feedback loop neural networks to process sequential data,
- `Tensors` mathematical objects that generalize scalars, vectors, and matrices into higher dimensions. A multi-dimensional array of numbers, and
- `uv` package management including use of `ruff` for linting and formatting

## Getting Started

Here are some instructions to help you set up this project locally.

---

## Installation Steps

The Python version used for this project is `Python 3.12` to be compatible with `PyTorch`.

Follow the requirements for [Using uv with PyTorch](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/pytorch/)

- Make sure to use python versions `Python 3.9‚Äì3.12
- pip version 19.0 or higher for Linux (requires manylinux2014 support) and Windows. pip version 20.3 or higher for macOS.
- Windows Native Requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019

### Clone the Repo

1. Clone the repo (or download it as a zip file):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beenlanced/ltsm_project_pytorch.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment named `.venv` using `uv` Python version 3.12:

   ```bash
   uv venv --python=3.12
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment: `.venv`

   On macOs and Linux:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate #mac
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```bash
    # In cmd.exe
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```

4. Install packages using `pyproject.toml` or (see special notes section)

   ```bash
   uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
   ```

### Install the Jupyter Notebook(s)

1. **Run the Project**

   - Run the Jupyter Notebook(s) in the Jupyter UI or in VS Code.

---

## Special Notes

- Including`requirements.txt` file as there are unique considerations when using the `TensorFlow` library. Plus, just in case you run into issues wth the `pyproject.toml` file there is the ability to use the requirements file as well to build the virtual environment.

- Running this notebook took approximately 25 minutes to run using an Apple M4 Pro with macOS Sequoia. Depending on the processor(s) that you are running this time will vary.

### Final Words

Thanks for visting.

Give the project a star (‚≠ê) if you liked it or if it was helpful to you!

You've `beenlanced`! üòâ
